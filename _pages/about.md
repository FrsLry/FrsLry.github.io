I am graduated from the [Msc Marine Sciences](http://sciencesdelamer.sorbonne-universite.fr/) of Sorbonne University where I focused mainly on statistical modeling of community dynamic (see the [Projects](https://frslry.github.io/projects/) tab to see my Master thesis project). 

I started my PhD in macroecology in October 2020 at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, at the [Dept. of Spatial Sciences](https://www.fzp.czu.cz/en/r-9407-departments/r-9471-departments/r-9649-department-of-spatial-sciences) under [Petr Keil](https://petrkeil.github.io/website/) supervision.

The main goal of my PhD is to **understand the link between biodiversity dynamic and spatio-temporal scales**. This link being [taxon dependent](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/oik.05968), I decided to focus on avian biodiversity. To tackle this problem, I am using machine learning methods to develop a framework that could be used on other taxa. 

Coding represent more than 50% of my research time. The [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) is my main language but I also use [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and a lot of different langugages (see [my CV](https://frslry.github.io/cv/)).
