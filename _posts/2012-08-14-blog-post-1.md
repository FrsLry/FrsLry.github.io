Introducing my humble personal website.

## What will you find here?

Mainly macroecology and programming stuff (and of course, programing for macroecology). These two topics independently could fill the curiosity of anyone for a lifetime but combining them is the best cocktail I have found. Hence, those are what I am studying everyday in my PhD. These terms being broad, they need a little clarifications.

### Macroecology

This is basically studying at large scales how and why the species are found where they are. This implies taking into account the relationships between the different species (biotic interactions) and between the species and their non living environment (abiotic interactions). For my PhD, I am focusing mainly on the biodiversity of birds at the scale of Czech Republic onward (but this shall be the topic of other blog posts). For this, I am using Artifical Intelligence algorithms and this bring us to my second dedication: programming. 

### Programming

Statistics are the main tool to work with when doing numerical ecology. But a bunch of other skills are needed when working with data: data visualization, data management, data mining... This set of tools is basically what is used to do data science. The [R programing language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is well known to have an extended library of statistical toolboxes. Along with all the other packages allowing to manage, visualize and to [share my work](https://github.com/FrsLry/), R is the language that I am using on a daily basis. But when you start to like coding and you realize their respective pros and cons, you can not limit yourself to one language. Thus, I am also interested in other languages such as Python, Matlab or Julia.
